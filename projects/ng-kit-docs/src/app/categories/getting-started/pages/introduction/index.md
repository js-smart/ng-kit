**ngx-kit** is a collection of reusable Angular components built with Angular Material and Bootstrap 5.x, Utility classes, functions for Date, Form and String operations. These are primarly designed for our projects


# Key Features
### Zero Dependencies
**ngx-oneforall** has **NO** third-party dependencies except Bootstrap. This reduces security risks, simplifies updates, and prevents version conflicts.

### Built for Modern Angular
Designed with **Signals** and **Standalone Components** in mind. This isn't a legacy port—it's built for the current and future state of Angular.

### Modular & Tree-shakable
Import only what you use. The library is fully tree-shakable, so adding one utility doesn't bloat your bundle with the rest of the library.
