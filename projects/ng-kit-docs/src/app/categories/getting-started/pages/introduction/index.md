**@js-smart/ng-kit** is a comprehensive collection of reusable Angular components, directives, and utilities built with Angular Material and Bootstrap 5.x. 

The library provides a rich set of UI components, powerful directives for common interactions, and utility functions for state management and other common tasks. Designed with modern Angular best practices, `@js-smart/ng-kit` offers a flexible, type-safe, and well-documented solution for building Angular applications.


# Key Features

## Low Dependencies
**@js-smart/ng-kit** has only one third-party dependency: Bootstrap. Minimal dependencies reduce security risks, simplify updates, and prevent version conflicts.

## Built for Modern Angular
Designed with **Angular Signals** and **Standalone Components** in mind. This isn't a legacy port—it's built for the current and future state of Angular, leveraging the latest features and best practices.

## Modular & Tree-shakable
Import only what you use. The library is fully tree-shakable, so adding one utility or component doesn't bloat your bundle with the rest of the library.

## Flexible Component Architecture
Components are available in two ways: as **directives** (recommended) for maximum flexibility, or as **components** (legacy) for backward compatibility. This dual approach allows you to apply functionality directly to existing elements or use dedicated components.

## Type-Safe & Well-Documented
Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions. All components, directives, and utilities are fully typed, providing excellent IDE support and compile-time safety.

## Angular Material Integration
Seamlessly integrates with Angular Material components, providing consistent styling and behavior across your application.

## Comprehensive Utilities
Includes powerful utilities for common tasks like progress state management, print functionality, and click throttling, all built with Angular Signals for reactive state management.
