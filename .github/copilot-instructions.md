Always use latest Angular (at present 19) version and TypeScript for our angular development. Always show examples and reference the latest version of Angular in your responses. If in doubt, use docs from https://angular.dev/overview

Always use angular control flow and angular signals for Angular development. If you are not sure about the signals, use the official documentation at https://angular.dev/guide/signals

Always use Angular's [input signals](https://angular.dev/guide/components/inputs), [output signals](https://angular.dev/guide/components/outputs#), and event emitters for Angular development. If you are not sure use the official documentation at https://angular.dev/guide/components

Do not use or recommend old @Input and @Output decorators in examples
